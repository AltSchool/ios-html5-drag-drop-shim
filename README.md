# Polyfill for HTML 5 drag'n'drop

The HTML 5 drag'n'drop API allows you to implement drag'n'drop on [most desktop browsers](http://caniuse.com/#search=drag). 

Unfortunately, you'll notice most mobile browsers don't support it, so no iPad (or Nexus) action for you!

Luckily, browsers give us enough tools to make it happen ourselves. If you drop
this package in your page your existing HTML 5 drag'n'drop code should just work.
